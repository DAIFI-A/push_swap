# Push_Swap

Push_Swap is a simple sorting algorithm project that aims to sort a stack of integers using two stacks and a set of instructions. This project is written in C language and is designed to run in a Linux environment.

# How to use
To use Push_Swap, follow these steps:

Clone the project into a Linux environment using the git clone command.
1. Run the make command to compile the project and generate the executable file.
2. Run the ./push_swap command followed by a list of integers that need to be sorted. For example, ./push_swap 5 2 9 1 would sort the integers 5, 2, 9, and 1.
# Project Description
The Push_Swap project is composed of two programs: push_swap and checker.

The push_swap program takes a list of integers as input and sorts them using two stacks and a set of predefined operations. The program then outputs the instructions required to sort the list in the most efficient way possible.

The checker program takes the same list of integers as input and checks if the instructions outputted by the push_swap program are valid, meaning the list is sorted correctly.

# Conclusion
Push_Swap is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm project that demonstrates the use of stacks and instructions in C programming. It is a useful exercise for anyone looking to improve their skills in C language and algorithm design.
